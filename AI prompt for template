  <!-- 📝 GLOBAL RULES (do not render in final notes):
      1. Each color (C1–C10) highlights links across: Code ↔ Explanation ↔ Notes ↔ Concept & Spirit.
      2. Section order: Code → Example Outputs → Explanation → Notes → Concept & Spirit.
      3. Voice: always beginner-friendly, clear, step-by-step.

      <!-- 3.3 CONCEPT & SPIRIT -->
      <h3>Concept & Spirit:</h3>
      <span>- Ask: Why did we write it this way? What coding habit or principle is this teaching?</span><br>
      <span>- Why this language feature exists and how it shapes coding mindset.</span><br>
      <span>- Big-picture lesson for beginners: how to think about and use this feature effectively and safely.</span>
