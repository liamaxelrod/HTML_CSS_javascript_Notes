## 2. Project Description

Was to refresh my memory and make it easier to recall things on HTML & CSS when I need to. Either by looking at the website or just simply because I took notes, what reinforces knowledge.

Also, I do have plans to refresh my knowledge on other coding languages and learn new ones. While doing this I plan on connecting all these languages with this website. The notes I take on the different coding languages I plan on creating connecting so they're all accessed through one website.

2. **Navigate to the project folder** on your computer.
3. **Open the `index.html` file** in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).

## 6. Lessons Learned

HTML:

Before this project, I had a Intermediate understanding of HTML and could Create HTML documents. Through this project, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of how it works and easier to recall and obscure details that if I ever need, will be easy to recall Or Even easier to learn again.

CSS:

Before this project, my understanding of CSS was fairly solid, but now I have a much deeper understanding of how styles interact and cascade. I’ve learned how multiple styles can affect the same elements, how to use modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid efficiently, and how to implement responsive design that works across different devices. Creating reusable templates reinforced how important consistency and clean structure are for both aesthetics and functionality.

ChatGPT / Learning Workflow:

Using ChatGPT as a learning aid has been incredibly helpful. Every time I create a template, I not only practice coding but also learn how to leverage AI to clarify concepts, generate examples, and catch mistakes. Revisiting the material multiple times while building the site has strengthened my retention and made it easier to recall concepts quickly. I also now have a better understanding of how HTML, and CSS, interact together, which is invaluable for future projects.
