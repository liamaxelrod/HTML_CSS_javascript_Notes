## 2. Project Description

the project was to refresh my memory and make it easier to recall things on JavaScript, HTML, & CSS when I need to. Either by looking at the website or just simply because I took notes, what reinforces knowledge.

Also, I do have plans to refresh my knowledge on other coding languages and learn new ones. While doing this I plan on connecting all these languages with this website. The notes I take on the different coding languages I plan on creating connecting so they're all accessed through one website.

## 5. How to Run Locally (Open index.html in your browser)

To view this project on your computer:

1. **Clone or download the repository** from GitHub.
2. **Navigate to the project folder** on your computer.
3. **Open the `index.html` file** in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
   * You can usually double-click the file, or right-click and choose  **“Open with” → your browser** .
4. The website should load fully, including all navigation, CSS styles, and dynamically loaded notes.

**Note:** No server setup or installation is required. Everything runs directly in the browser.

## 6. Lessons Learned

HTML:

Before this project, I had a Intermediate understanding of HTML and could Create HTML documents. Through this project, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of how it works and easier to recall and obscure details that if I ever need, will be easy to recall Or Even easier to learn again.

CSS:

Before this project, my understanding of CSS was fairly solid, but now I have a much deeper understanding of how styles interact and cascade. I’ve learned how multiple styles can affect the same elements, how to use modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid efficiently, and how to implement responsive design that works across different devices. Creating reusable templates reinforced how important consistency and clean structure are for both aesthetics and functionality.

JavaScript:
I already had a good understanding of Javascript and how it worked. After taking these notes, I've reinforced that knowledge. I didn't take away as much as I did from the CSS or HTML, but I'm still glad I did it because it reinforced the knowledge into my mind and will make it easier to use next time I use it in a project.

ChatGPT / Learning Workflow:

Warning > while AI is a useful tool, always keep in mind It's not perfect and Don't become reliant on it.

Learning Through Project Work:
Using ChatGPT as a learning aid has been incredibly helpful. Every time I create a template, I not only practice coding but also learn how to leverage AI to clarify concepts, generate examples, and catch mistakes. I’ve learned how to better inform ChatGPT about how I like my templates structured, which helps in other aspects of using AI. Revisiting the material multiple times while building the site has strengthened my retention and made it easier to recall concepts quickly. I also now have a better understanding of how HTML, CSS, and JavaScript interact, which is invaluable for future projects.

Shortcut:
I learned that I can create a reusable prompt to generate templates the way I like. However, it’s important to remember that no prompt is ever perfect. AI is constantly evolving, and sometimes templates created from prompts may not work exactly as expected or may become outdated. A template prompt is a helpful tool, but don’t expect it to be flawless — it’s a guide, not a guarantee.

Smart Workflow Tip:
A new trick I learned is to use ChatGPT alongside GitHub as a source of truth for the project. By sharing the repo URL, ChatGPT can reference the file structure, file names, and contents directly. Whenever I push updates, the latest version becomes the master copy. This makes asking questions, reorganizing folders, or requesting improvements faster and keeps context consistent across conversations. (Yet to be tested??)


Structural Lessons

This is the kind of knowledge you can only develop through practice. You don’t really improve until you start building real projects. With this project, I learned how to name things more clearly and how to format comments so they’re actually helpful and easy to follow. I fully expect that when I look back on this project in the future, I’ll notice things I don’t like or things I could have done better. That’s natural — structural integrity and thoughtful design are skills you really only develop by making mistakes, reflecting on them, and figuring out how to do things better next time.

I’ve revised my file structure and naming conventions multiple times because I wasn’t satisfied, or I realized the way I’d formatted or named something didn’t make sense. The same applies to my code formatting. This is the type of lesson you only learn by writing code, running into problems later, and discovering why your older code doesn’t integrate well with the new functionality you’re trying to add.

Security

It was only after finishing the CSS, HTML, and JavaScript parts of the project that I started thinking seriously about security. While these coding notes websites don’t necessarily require strict security, it’s still good practice to understand where vulnerabilities might exist and how to address them. That way, when I work on projects that do require security, I’ll already know how to implement it, why it’s necessary, and what to look out for while writing or preparing code.

## 7. Future Improvements

Attach the home button to my home website. What I have not created yet.

In all notes. Example.html There's a comment at the bottom about last little things to fix. (Security features/And little things to fix in some unfinished templates)
