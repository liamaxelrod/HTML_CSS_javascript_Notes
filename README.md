## 2. Project Description

Was to refresh my memory and make it easier to recall things on JavaScript when I need to. Either by looking at the website or just simply because I took notes, what reinforces knowledge.

Also, I do have plans to refresh my knowledge on other coding languages and learn new ones. While doing this I plan on connecting all these languages with this website. The notes I take on the different coding languages I plan on creating connecting so they're all accessed through one website.

## 6. Lessons Learned

JavaScript:

ChatGPT / Learning Workflow:

Using ChatGPT as a learning aid has been incredibly helpful. Every time I create a template, I not only practice coding but also learn how to leverage AI to clarify concepts, generate examples, and catch mistakes. Revisiting the material multiple times while building the site has strengthened my retention and made it easier to recall concepts quickly. I also now have a better understanding of how HTML, and CSS, interact together, which is invaluable for future projects.
