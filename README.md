## 2. Project Description

the project was to refresh my memory and make it easier to recall things on JavaScript, HTML, & CSS when I need to. Either by looking at the website or just simply because I took notes, what reinforces knowledge.

Also, I do have plans to refresh my knowledge on other coding languages and learn new ones. While doing this I plan on connecting all these languages with this website. The notes I take on the different coding languages I plan on creating connecting so they're all accessed through one website.

## 5. How to Run Locally (Open index.html in your browser)

To view this project on your computer:

1. **Clone or download the repository** from GitHub.
2. **Navigate to the project folder** on your computer.
3. **Open the `index.html` file** in your preferred web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
   * You can usually double-click the file, or right-click and choose  **“Open with” → your browser** .
4. The website should load fully, including all navigation, CSS styles, and dynamically loaded notes.

**Note:** No server setup or installation is required. Everything runs directly in the browser.

## 6. Lessons Learned

HTML:

Before this project, I had a Intermediate understanding of HTML and could Create HTML documents. Through this project, I’ve gained a deeper understanding of how it works and easier to recall and obscure details that if I ever need, will be easy to recall Or Even easier to learn again.

CSS:

Before this project, my understanding of CSS was fairly solid, but now I have a much deeper understanding of how styles interact and cascade. I’ve learned how multiple styles can affect the same elements, how to use modern layout techniques like Flexbox and Grid efficiently, and how to implement responsive design that works across different devices. Creating reusable templates reinforced how important consistency and clean structure are for both aesthetics and functionality.

JavaScript:
I already had a good understanding of Javascript and how it worked. After taking these notes, I've reinforced that knowledge. I didn't take away as much as I did from the CSS or HTML, but I'm still glad I did it because it reinforced the knowledge into my mind and will make it easier to use next time I use it in a project. 

ChatGPT / Learning Workflow:

Using ChatGPT as a learning aid has been incredibly helpful. Every time I create a template, I not only practice coding but also learn how to leverage AI to clarify concepts, generate examples, and catch mistakes. I also learned how to better inform  ChatGPT How I like my template structured. What can Help in other aspects when using ChatGPT. Revisiting the material multiple times while building the site has strengthened my retention and made it easier to recall concepts quickly. I also now have a better understanding of howJavascript, interact together, which is invaluable for future projects.
