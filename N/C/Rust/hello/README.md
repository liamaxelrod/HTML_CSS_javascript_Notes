# Title / What it covers

**Rust Basics: Hello World**

---

# Description

This snippet demonstrates the most basic Rust program: printing output to the console. It introduces beginners to Rust’s `main` function and the `println!` macro.

---

# Code Purpose

The purpose of this code is to provide a starting point for Rust programming. It teaches how to write a minimal Rust program, run it, and see output on the console. This is often the first program any beginner writes when learning a new language.

---

# How it works

1. **`fn main()`**
   * The `main` function is the entry point of every Rust program.
   * Code inside `main` runs when the program starts.
2. **`println!` Macro**
   * `println!` prints text to the console.
   * The `!` indicates that `println` is a macro, not a regular function.
   * Text inside quotes `"..."` is displayed exactly as written.

---

# Output / Example Run

```
Hello World!
```

> Note: This program does not take input or perform calculations. It simply prints text to the console.

# Key Concepts / Lessons

* **`main` Function** : All Rust programs start execution here.
* **Macros** : `println!` is a macro, which can take special formatting arguments.
* **Basic Output** : Shows how to display messages to the user.
* **Rust Syntax** : Introduces `fn` for function declaration and semicolons `;` to end statements.

---

# Tips / Beginner Notes

* Experiment by changing the string inside `println!` to see different outputs.
* Add multiple `println!` statements to print several lines.
* Use formatting with `{}` to print variable values once you learn about variables.
