# Rust Operations - Beginner-Friendly Examples

## What this example shows

This folder contains Rust code examples for practicing **operators** in Rust. It corresponds to the HTML template: `N/C/Rust/operations/main.rs`.

* **Arithmetic Operators** : `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`
* **Assignment Operators** : `=`, `+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`
* **Comparison Operators** : `==`, `!=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`
* **Logical Operators** : `&&`, `||`, `!`

## Learning Purpose

* The learning purpose is to visually see the code run and interact with it.

## How to run it

1. Copy the Rust file `operations.rs` into your Rust project.
2. Open terminal in this folder
3. Run:

```bash
cargo run            # if part of a Cargo project
rustc operations.rs && ./operations  # Linux/macOS
rustc operations.rs && operations.exe # Windows
```

4. Experiment by changing numbers, variable values, and boolean expressions.
