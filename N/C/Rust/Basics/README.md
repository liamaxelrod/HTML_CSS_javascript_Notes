# Rust Basics - Beginner-Friendly Examples

## What this example shows

This folder contains beginner-friendly Rust code corresponding to the HTML template: `N/C/Rust/Basics/main.rs`.

1. **Comments**
   * Single-line `//` and block `/* ... */`
2. **Variables**
   * Immutable (`let x = 5;`) and mutable (`let mut y = 10;`)
3. **Data Types**
   * Integers, floats, char, boolean, string
   * Type inference vs explicit type declaration
4. **Printing**
   * `print!` vs `println!`
   * Placeholders `{}` and named placeholders
5. **Constants**
   * `const` variables that cannot change
   * Must always have a type

## Learning Purpose
