     NOTES ON SECURITY SYSTEM
     ======================================
1. Only local files or trusted CDNs are loaded.
2. integrity & crossorigin prevent tampered files from executing.
3. Google Fonts is used without SRI — acceptable but consider self-hosting for high-security needs.
4. No inline JavaScript is in this head template → reduces XSS risks.
5. <title> is per-page, outside template, to allow flexibility per HTML document.
